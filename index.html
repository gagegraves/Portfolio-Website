          <h3>About Gage</h3>
          <img src="images/motherboard.jpg" width="600" alt="computer motherboard" class="other" />
          <p>Ever since I was little, I've been curious about technology. I taught myself how to
            build and troubleshoot computers growing up, and in highschool I took programming and
            video game design classes to keep learning about my passion.</p>
          <p>As a full-time online student at <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/">Thinkful</a>, I can continue
            to enjoy learning, and look forward to joining the industry in an exciting career!</p>
          <p>If you're looking to hire a new developer in the future (or are looking for a Halo
            co-op partner) then please reach out! I am excited to build amazing software with other great
            developers.</p>
